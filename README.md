## AI Algorithms

### DFS & BFS :
I've made two algorithms for each one to show how they work.


### Greedy & A* & UCS :
##### They look pretty much like each other but there is one difference:

**Greedy** calculate h_cost (heuristic cost),

**UCS** calculate g_cost (path cost),

**A\*** calculate f_cost (f_cost = g_cost + h_cost)


### MinMax & Alpha_Beta:
 Alpha-Beta Pruning is more efficient than the Minimax algorithm because it avoids evaluating parts of the search tree that are not necessary to determine the best move.

##### so, for:
**MinMax** I made a Connect 4 game to show how this algorithm works & added **Implementation** to focus more on it.

**Alpha_Beta** I made a Tic Tac Toe game to understand the difference between it and MINMAX.

that's it, see you ;)
